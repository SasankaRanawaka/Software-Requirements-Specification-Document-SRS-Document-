 <h1>Software Requirements Specification Document (SRS Document)</h1>
    
  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        In my first year at university, I developed a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for an online banking application. This project helped me gain experience in requirements analysis, user needs assessment, and detailed documentation, providing a strong foundation in software development practices. It was a valuable exercise in defining system functionalities and improving project planning skills.
